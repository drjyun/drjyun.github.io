### *NEURD is taking shape. The second meet-up featured discussions on Bayesian statistics, the strengths and weakness of generative models compared to machine learning and Indian food in the heart of Cologne, Germany. Want to join and become a fellow Neurdling? Just send us a [mail](mailto:neurdsarefun@gmail.com)!*

NEURD is a regional community of early career researchers (ECRs) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. After our first successful kick-off meeting in Heinrich-Heine-University DÃ¼sseldorf our second meeting was hosted by [arangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com) in Cologne. 

The meeting started with a key-note on [Bayesian Modeling of Choice](/files/html/NeurdPres.html). This stirred a discussion on several general questions: 

What are the distinctive advantages of Bayesian stats and are there case when you actually should not use it? When is it useful to use generative models instead of machine learning and statistics? Can we combine machine learning approaches with generative models to test theory?

Discussions faded into delicious Indian food in the heart of cologne before everyone headed home with head full of new ideas.

Meetings will now be held regularily on the first monday of the month in varying locations (so save the date for our next meeting on December 2)! Rumours say, there will be shirts featuring the NEURD logo.
