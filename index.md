## About

I am a PhD Student in Prof. Tobias Kalenscher's Lab at Heinrich-Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. I'm interested in neural, pharmacological and computational underpinnings of rational decision-making. I'm enthusiastic about bayesian modelling. 

Beyond research, I sing in a Jazz & Hip-Hop Band (see pic) and am founder and elected co-director of the NGO *Learning Goal Germany*.
