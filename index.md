I am a convex combination of a psychologist and data scientist. I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at New Mexico State University and a visiting fellow at Wharton Neuroscience Initiative, the University of Pennsylvania. I am also on the editorial review board of the Asia Marketing Journal. 

I get creative when leveraging large datasets to answer marketing research questions. In addition to traditional lab and field experiments, I build AI deep learning models and employ neuroimaging (fMRI and EEG), natural language processing, econometric, and computational models. My work has appeared in PNAS Nexus, Journal of Business Ethics, PloS One, Psychology & Marketing, and Journal of Business Research. Plus, I consult with start-ups and deliver business analytics perspectives. 

I received the postdoctoral fellow training at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and obtained a Ph.D. at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) business school in Seoul. I was also the honored recipient of a Global Ph.D. Fellowship (GPF) funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF: Total Grant: 130,000 USD / 5yrs).
