# Playing around with #rtistry for my dissertation cover
Posted on Aug, 30, 2021.

The last days I have been trying out some generative art in R, to use for my dissertation cover. In the process I have created a Shiny app, that presents you questions from Pop-Songtitles and visualizes your responses as a decision path. Stochastically, a path might branch off and show you how a different state of the world would look like. Feel free to [try out](https://fjnitsch.shinyapps.io/DecisionArt/) and send me your prettiest results:


# New Blogpost! Resumé of Open Neuroscience & Psychology
Posted on Aug 11, 2021.

During the last year (#corona), I have taught 4-week online course on open science in the fields of neuroscience and psychology. In an attempt to fully utilize the online teaching format, I utilized various channels of communication such as YouTube-Videos, interactive WebEx-Sessions, media- and research articles, brief presentations, and an essay project. As of this winter, I will no longer be able to teach the course (news coming soon). Hence, with this blog post, I want to provide a quick wrap-up of the students’ evaluations, my own experiences and the future of the course.

# My first registered report: IPA at Royal Society Open Science
Posted on Aug 11, 2020.

![Registered Reports](/files/images/RsosPubFig.pdf)

Super stoked that my first #RegisteredReport got in-principle accepted at Royal Society Open Science!
[OSF](https://osf.io/akgt9/).

"The influence of memory processes on choice consistency"

Fully Bayesian, including self-replication and cognitive modelling.

# Registered Reports for Early Career Researchers
Posted on Apr 7, 2020.

![Registered Reports](/files/images/RR-Benefits.jpg)

In the April NEURD meeting we discussed open science for ECR.
In the slide shown above I argue that Registered Reports have
particular benefits for ECR besides idealistic reasons.

You can find the whole presentation [here](https://fjnitsch.github.io/pages/resources.html).

# New Pre-Print out!
Posted on Feb 18, 2020.

**Keeping a cool head at all times. What determines choice consistency?**

In a review of recent literature we identify trait and state factors that
influence the consistency (i.e. quality) of our decisions and find
some unexpected results.

# Launch of NEURD - meetup for computational neuroscience

![NEURD Logo](/files/images/NEURD-logo.png)

**NEURD** is a regional community of early career researchers in computational neuroscience, psychology and related disciplines. We organize rotating short presentations with subsequent discussion. The aim is to learn from each other and to network.

Are you an early career researcher in computational neuroscience (around NRW, Germany)?
Then we are just the right meetup to join!
