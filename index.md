# About Me

I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/felix-jan-nitsch) in Marketing at INSEAD Business School, where I study consumer behavior, specifically with a focus on transformative consumer research and consumer protection. I  work closely together with Hilke Plassmann and often seek the excellent advice of Klaus Wertenbroich.

In my research I use my background in cognitive and biological psychology as well as behavioral economics to analyze consumer behavior for potential imbalances and vulnerabilities. Thereby I draw upon an array of state-of-the-art methods ranging from gamified online experiments, over web-scraping and Bayesian cognitive models, to hormonal analyses.

In my spare time I lead EDUCAT, an international non-profit association of ca. 30 volunteers from Syria to Kenya that consults educational projects in the Global South on impact measurement and fundraising.
