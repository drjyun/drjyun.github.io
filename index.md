I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/felix-jan-nitsch) in Marketing at INSEAD. I am on the 2024 job market for faculty positions in Marketing.

I am interested in consumer and managerial judgment and decision-making, and their two-way relationship with mental well-being. My goal is to understand how psychological stressors and incentives shape behavior and, vice versa, how consumers’ and marketing managers’ decisions affect consumer mental well-being.

My training and PhD are in experimental psychology. My transition to marketing was motivated by the desire to apply my skills to contexts that are relevant to consumer and societal welfare. During my Post Doc, I worked closely together with [Hilke Plassmann](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/hilke-plassmann) and [Klaus Wertenbroch](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/klaus-wertenbroch).

I also ad honorem lead [EDUCAT](https://www.educatgermany.com), an international non-profit association of ca. 30 volunteers from Syria to Kenya. In a nutshell, we consult educational projects in the Global South on impact measurement and fundraising.
