I am a convex combination of a psychologist and data scientist. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In August 2025, I will join New Mexico State University as an Assistant Professor of Marketing.

I get creative when leveraging large datasets to answer marketing research questions. In addition to traditional lab and field experiments, I build AI deep learning models and employ wearable brain imaging, natural language processing, and computational models. Plus, I consult with start-ups and deliver business analytics perspectives.

I also obtained a Ph.D. at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) business school in Seoul. I was also the honored recipient of a Global Ph.D. Fellowship (GPF) funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF: Total Grant: 130,000 USD / 5yrs).
