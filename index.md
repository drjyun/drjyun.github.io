I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/felix-jan-nitsch) in Marketing at INSEAD. Done with the market :)

I am interested in the behavioral mechanisms of why and how people post content on social media platforms, how these decisions are shaped by platform rewards and high-level platform design features, and, how users are affected psychologically in the process. To this end, I combine quantitative analyses of web-scraped data with analytic models and behavioral experiments. My research speaks to the understanding of consumer behavior on social media, to the supply and demand for self-expressive communication, and to the alignment of consumer and firm interests on these platforms.

I have an eclectic methodological training in behavioral economics, computational psychology, and decision neuroscience, that is reflected in my current publication record. My training allows me to choose the most appropriate from a large set of methodological approaches to answer my research questions.

During my Post Doc, I worked closely together with [Hilke Plassmann](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/hilke-plassmann) and [Klaus Wertenbroch](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/klaus-wertenbroch).

I also ad honorem lead [EDUCAT](https://www.educatgermany.com), an international non-profit association of ca. 30 volunteers from Syria to Kenya. In a nutshell, we consult educational projects in the Global South on impact measurement and fundraising.
