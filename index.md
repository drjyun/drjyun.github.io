I am a convex combination of a psychologist and data scientist. I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at New Mexico State University and a visiting fellow at Wharton Neuroscience Initiative, the University of Pennsylvania.

I get creative when leveraging large datasets to answer marketing research questions. In addition to traditional lab and field experiments, I build AI deep learning models and employ neuroimaging (fMRI and EEG), natural language processing, econometric, and computational models. My work has appeared in PNAS Nexus, Journal of Business Ethics, Psychology & Marketing, and Journal of Business Research. Plus, I consult with start-ups and deliver business analytics perspectives. 

I received the postdoctoral fellow training at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and obtained a Ph.D. at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) business school in Seoul. I was also the honored recipient of a Global Ph.D. Fellowship (GPF) funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF: Total Grant: 130,000 USD / 5yrs).
