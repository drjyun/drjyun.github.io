NEURD is a regional community of early career researchers in computational neuroscience, psychology and related disciplines. We organize rotating short presentations with subsequent discussion. The aim is to learn from each other and to network.

Are you an early career researcher in computational neuroscience (around NRW, Germany)?
Than we are just the right meetup to join!
