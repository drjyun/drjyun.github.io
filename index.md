## Current projects

### Stress and decision-making

I am investigating time-dependent stress effects on different domains
of decision-making. I am using a microeconomic theoretical framework
and combine behavioural and neuroendrinological methodology.

### Hyperbaric Pressure

The influence of hyperbaric pressure on complex psychological functions
such as decisions is barely understood. Potential applications in
recreational and professional diving are manifold.

### Framing, Affect and Rationality

The influence of framing on decisions under risk is a thoroughly investigated
phenomenon. I want to disentangle different concepts of irrationality in
the concept of framing and affect.

## Previous projects

### Differential memory constancy in experience-based and fabricated memories

In my masterthesis I investigated differences in memory constancy between different semantic information types and sources of memory. Results are relevant for forensic-psychological practice.
